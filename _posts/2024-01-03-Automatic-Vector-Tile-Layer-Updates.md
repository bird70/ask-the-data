Working with Web GIS layers in ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise can be very easy, as long as it's done interactively via a web browser or an Esri client application such as ArcGIS Pro.

Once regular updates to layers are needed, the story changes quite a bit and in this post I want to give an example for using `arcpy` and the `ArcGIS Python API` to script regular updates to a pre-styled Vector Tile Layer.

Imagine you have data which change on a regular basis and that need to be provided through ArcGIS Online for consumption by external customers via a web app. ArcGIS Online cannot make a connection to the data your organisation's network, so data need to be uploaded. You can do that interactively, but as soon as you'll need to make updates more frequently, you'll want some form of automation for it. That's what the `ArcGIS Python API` is perfect for.

# Requirements

[Here's my example](https://topnetvisdemo.netlify.app):

    > A country-wide dataset (ca. 2 million line geometries) that needs to be updated 4 times daily, using new data. The geometries are static in our case, it's the attributes which are attached to each of the line segments which change and which are used for symbolising the lines in different colours/hues, indicating the level of an attribute.

- A public-facing application will be used to display the data in a zoomable map. Good performance needed at all zoom levels
- The example application above ultimately also needs to allow a user to click on a line segment to create a current chart of data, but that process is separate from the Vector Tile Layer updates which I describe in this post (as it uses a live layer connection via ArcGIS Enterprise).
- 4 times daily updates (attributes only)
- ca. 2 Mio records (12 attributes)

# Solution overview

We are using a pre-styled Vector Tile Cache [Vector Tile Layer for ArcGIS Online/ArcGIS Enterprise apps](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/3.1/help/data/services/use-vector-tiled-layers.htm)

Here's the process used at an overview level:

1. Updates to the data are run on a local server, using a scripted process (Python), against data stored in Microsoft SQL Server
2. A stored map file for ArcGIS Pro provides symbology that is used for the updated layer. Basically, the map file uses a link to the database feature class and contains rules for how the layer needs to be rendered (the colours for the different attribute levels)
3. The script creates a Vector Tile cache, using the above map file with the current data, on the local processing machine.
4. The pre-made cache is uploaded to ArcGIS Enterprise and published as a layer which can be displayed in an existing web map/app

The code we use is based on `arcpy` and `ArcGIS Python API` and uses PyODBC to provide fast updates in the SDE database in SQL Server. (If your requirements don't dictate using an Enterprise relational Geodatabase, you can probably get away with using a File Geodatabase just as easily.)
