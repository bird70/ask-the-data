Happy New Year!

Recently I've found nice ways to apply Esri's Arcade script language, which is similar to JavaScript, to populate fields that are displayed in a Web App popup when a user clicks on the map.

[Arcade script expressions](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/) in ArcGIS Web Maps can be used for various tasks, including querying feature layer data and returning results as formatted popups. (So this post refers specifically to the "popup profile" in Arcade.)
