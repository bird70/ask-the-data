# About this blog

Hi - I'm Tilmann and I work with data in many forms. This blog documents some of the work that I'm doing, always in the hope that others will find it useful as well.

I am planning to add more posts whenever I think something is not very well described elsewhere or where I think more examples could help.

Spatial datasets are not always part of the story, but I would expect them to crop up every now and again, both because - as they say - spatial can be special, and because I work with spatial datasets a lot.

Stay tuned ...
